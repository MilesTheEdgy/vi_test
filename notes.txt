Okay
A little bit of reconciling
I need to verify my goals for the varol iletisim project, and for the other projects as well
As far as Varol iletisim goes, it needed 2 roles, but I created 3.
•	Dealer
•	Sales Assistant
•	Sales Assistant Chef
Since I need to ship it to erdem first, I will make a combination of the sales assistant and sales assistant chef roles.
I will call it the Admin role.
The admin role will be able to:
•	Process, approve and delete applications
•	Accept new users, deactivate users
•	See a detailed report of user activites
The dealer role will be able to:
•	Send new applications
•	View their current applications
These are the current requirements, They might increase later on.
The applications itself will have:
•	Create new account through email verification
•	Change password in client
•	Reset password incase user forgets it
