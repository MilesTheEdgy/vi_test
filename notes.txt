2 client routes: Reset password verify and Reset password new
2 server routes: GET resetpassword and PUT resetpassword

Client sends his email, server queries his user info through his email in the database.
If the query returns info, servers sends an email containing an html with a password reset ID link, and stores the reset ID in the database
Client clicks this link, sends reset ID to server, servers queries database again
If the query returns the ID, the server sends a 200 request and redirects the client to Reset Password new route



Okay
A little bit of reconciling
I need to verify my goals for the varol iletisim project, and for the other projects as well
As far as Varol iletisim goes, it needed 2 roles, but I created 3.
•	Dealer
•	Sales Assistant
•	Sales Assistant Chef
Since I need to ship it to erdem first, I will make a combination of the sales assistant and sales assistant chef roles.
I will call it the Admin role.
The admin role will be able to:
•	Process, approve and delete applications
•	Accept new users, deactivate users
•	See a detailed report of user activites
The dealer role will be able to:
•	Send new applications
•	View their current applications
These are the current requirements, They might increase later on.
The applications itself will have:
•	Create new account through email verification
•	Change password in client
•	Reset password incase user forgets it
