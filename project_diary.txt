So erdem wants me to do what exactly?

He wants me to add a balance system. for each dealer application submission, after approval, the dealer will increase his balance according to the fullfilled service

So for each dealer, there will be a balance column
that will be affected after approval of their submissions

MEANING:
FOR USER: insert get balance
FOR DEALER, GET /balance
FOR SD AND SDC: PUT APPLICATION, on approval increment dealer's balance.

This will be the gist of it, however he wanted me to do one more thing. the fuck was it...

Oh, he wanted a detailed monthly report of the transaction that occurred for all dealers. Depending on how many approved application submissions the dealer made.
So basically, for every approved submission, added balance amount, there needs to be something that can track it, and report it monthly.

What if I made a function that runs at the end of the month?

Okay a library called bree will do that trick

now let's do some test implementation

break done :(

now,

before we do these test implementations, I need to add the balance feature.

AFTER I add the balance feature, and the balance monthly report feature, I can ship the app.
